//James found a love letter his friend Harry has written for his girlfriend. James is a prankster, so he decides to meddle with the letter. He changes all the words in the letter into palindromes.

To do this, he follows two rules:

He can reduce the value of a letter, e.g. he can change d to c, but he cannot change c to d.
In order to form a palindrome, if he has to repeatedly reduce the value of a letter, he can do it until the letter becomes a. Once a letter has been changed to a, it can no longer be changed.
Each reduction in the value of any letter is counted as a single operation. Find the minimum number of operations required to convert a given string into a palindrome.//

            for(int j=s.length()-1;j>=(s.length()/2);j--){ 
                if(s.charAt(j)!=s.charAt(x)){
                    count = count + Math.abs(s.charAt(j)-s.charAt(x));
                }
